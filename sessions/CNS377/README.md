# CNS377 | Optimizing Amazon EKS costs through workload analysis and observability

While scaling with Karpenter, Spot instances, and Graviton processors are well-known cost-saving solutions for Amazon EKS, their effective implementation at scale demands thorough workload understanding. This presentation introduces a data-driven framework for optimizing EKS costs in production environments. Through detailed workload analysis and comprehensive monitoring, you'll learn how to select and implement the most suitable cost-optimization strategies for your specific workloads. We'll share a proven planning process to maximize cost savings while maintaining performance, supported by real-world examples and practical implementation guidelines.
