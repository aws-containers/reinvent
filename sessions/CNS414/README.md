# CNS414 | Scale, optimize, and upgrade your Kubernetes cluster with Karpenter 

Dive deep into Karpenter, the CNCF open-source project that serves as a flexibile, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler built with AWS. This advanced chalk talk explores Karpenter's scaling algorithms, and sophisticated node provisioning strategies. Learn how to implement complex scheduling constraints, optimize node selection using custom provisioners, and architect automated node upgrade strategies. We will examine use cases including multi-architecture workloads, spot instance handling, and performance tuning. Ideal for experienced Kubernetes operators and platform engineers.
