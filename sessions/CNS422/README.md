# CNS422 | Modernize containers for AI agents using AgentCore Gateway

In this session, learn how to transform your existing containerized applications into powerful components of modern AI-powered workflows. We'll demonstrate how AgentCore Gateway acts as a bridge, enabling your Amazon EKS-based microservices to seamlessly interact with AI agents without requiring substantial refactoring or rebuilding. Through practical examples and a live demonstration, we'll explore a key modernization pattern that allows organizations to leverage their existing container investments while participating in the emerging landscape of agentic systems. You'll see firsthand how AgentCore Gateway can expose your microservice interfaces, making them instantly accessible to AI agents and enabling participation in complex, automated workflows.
