# CNS420 | Shuffle, Scale, Succeed: Optimizing Spark Performance on Amazon EKS 

Running Apache Spark on Amazon EKS delivers scalability, but poor defaults can drive up costs and slow pipelines. This ChalkTalk highlights the top Spark performance challenges and production-proven fixes. Learn how Apache Iceberg reduces query times with metadata pruning, how DataFusion Comet accelerates Spark SQL by ~2.4x, and how Gluten with Velox delivers up to 3x gains. We will compare Comet and Gluten, demonstrate Apache Celeborn for remote shuffle scaling, and share EKS optimizations including custom batch schedulers, dynamic scaling with Karpenter, and Spark DRA. Data teams will receive a practical playbook on implementing faster and more cost-effective Spark workloads.
