# CNS429 | Under the hood: Architecting Amazon EKS for scale and performance

Amazon EKS continues to push the boundaries of what's possible. Join this session to understand the engineering principles and design decisions that drive Amazon EKS's evolution to support massive scale while maintaining simplicity and reliability. We'll highlight key Kubernetes control plane performance improvements and storage layer optimizations made to support ultra-scale clusters of up to 100k nodes. We'll also share our approach to providing customers more flexibility and choice over their control plane's performance and capacity.
