# CNS418 | Design multi-region resilience strategies on Amazon EKS 

Join this session to learn how to design highly available, resilient Amazon EKS deployments that span multiple AWS regions. This chalktalk explores architectural patterns for robust multi-region Amazon EKS workloads, including network connectivity models, cross-region replication strategies, and automated failover mechanisms. We'll demonstrate how to leverage GitOps, AWS Global Accelerator, Route 53, and EKS features to create seamless global application experiences while maintaining regional isolation for compliance and fault tolerance.
