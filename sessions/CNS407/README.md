# CNS407 | Master KRMOps: Declarative resource management with Amazon EKS and kro

Managing cloud resources and applications in Kubernetes environments often leads to complex, fragmented deployment processes that hinder operational efficiency. Attend this advanced session to discover how to unify cloud resource management using Kubernetes Resource Model Operations (KRMOps) with kro and AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK). Learn how to leverage these tools to package applications and cloud resource dependencies into cohesive deployable units using the KRMOps. You will gain practical experience in implementing declarative AWS resource management, automating dependency resolution, and enabling self-healing infrastructure - essential skills required for running large-scale Amazon EKS deployments for data and AI.
