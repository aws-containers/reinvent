# CNS417 | Networking and observability strategies for Kubernetes

Join this session to explore advanced networking and observability capabilities in Amazon EKS, from securing multi-tenant environments to gaining deep visibility into cluster traffic patterns. We'll share comprehensive strategies for implementing layered network security controls at both infrastructure and application layers which enable granular traffic observability and optimize network performance across distributed workloads. Learn best practices for fine-grained access control, efficient traffic monitoring, and automated policy enforcement. Finally, discover how to leverage Amazon EKS' integration with AWS services to build robust, observable, and secure Kubernetes environments while maintaining operational efficiency.
