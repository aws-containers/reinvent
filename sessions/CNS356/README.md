# CNS356 | Master identity-first security with Amazon EKS Auto Mode 

Is your Amazon EKS environment following security best practices? This session shows you how to implement granular access controls using AWS native capabilities, building on the strong security foundation that EKS Auto Mode provides. Through interactive discussion and whiteboarding, examine sophisticated approaches to user access management, from enterprise identity integration through AWS IAM Identity Center to RBAC and ABAC policies. Discover how EKS Auto Mode simplifies pod identity management while maintaining strict security boundaries. Walk through real-world examples of implementing least-privilege security across your Kubernetes landscape.
