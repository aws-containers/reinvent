# CNS405 | Cloud-native Java on Amazon EKS 

Learn how to build cloud-native Java applications based on best practices, and discover ways you can optimize application performance for fast startup and efficient resource usage in containerized environments. In this builders' session, gain hands-on experience you will learn how to reduce memory overhead, lower cold start latency, and achieve sub-second startup times when building Java applications on Amazon EKS. You will also learn how to use Amazon Bedrock to analyze profiling and thread dump data to uncover performance patterns and generate optimization insights.

## Session Resources

During this workshop you have built container images with Spring Boot Java Application, applied different optimization techniques and deployed container images with Java Application to Amazon EKS cluster.

You have successfully build cloud-native Java applications based on best practices, and discovered ways you can optimize application performance for fast startup and efficient resource usage in containerized environments. You have also learned how to use Amazon Bedrock to analyze profiling and thread dump data to uncover performance patterns and generate optimization insights.
